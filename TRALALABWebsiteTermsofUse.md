Last Updated: Apr 1, 2024

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this Service, and any service or material we provide on the Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.
<br>You are responsible for both: (1) making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Service; and (2) ensuring that all persons who access the Service through your internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them.
<br>To access the Service or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Service that all the information you provide on the Service is correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with this Service or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Service, is governed by our Privacy Policy (https://trala.me/), and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.
<br>If you choose or are provided with a username, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to this Service or portions of it using your user name, password, or other security information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.
<br>We have the right to disable any user name, password, or other identifiers, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.

## Data processing Addendum

### 1. Data ACCESS AND CONTROL.

You can view, access, edit, or delete your information for certain aspects of the Service via your Settings page. You can view, access, edit, or delete your personal information by logging into the Service and visiting your account profile page. You may also send us an email at (contact@trala.me) to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to edit information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. You may also have certain additional rights:

- _For a user in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom_
  You have certain rights under the respective European and UK General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”). These include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii) request rectification or erasure; (iii) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) request portability of your personal data. Additionally, if we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

- _For a user who is a California resident_
  You have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). These include the right to (i) request access to, details regarding, and a copy of the personal information we have collected about you and/or shared with third parties; (ii) request deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you; and (iii) the right to opt-out of sale of your personal information. As the terms are defined under the CCPA, we do not “sell” your “personal information.”

- _Exercise rights under GDPR, CCPA, or other data protection or privacy law_
  If you wish to exercise your rights under the GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable data protection or privacy laws, please contact us by using the “Submit a request” link here or at the address provided in Section 13 below, specify your request, and reference the applicable law. We may ask you to verify your identity, or ask for more information about your request. We will consider and act upon any above request in accordance with applicable law. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

- _Cases where the right to erasure does not apply_
  The right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:
  - for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
  - for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
  - for reasons of public interest in the area of public health;
  - for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes; or
  - for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

### 2. Data Protection.

We care about the security of your information and implement measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Also, we urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Service like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Service.
<br>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained in the Service.

### 3. DATA RETENTION

We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the Service, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may continue to retain your personal information even after you deactivate your account and/or cease to use the Service if such retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, and/or protect our legitimate interests. Where your personal information is no longer required for these purposes, all your personal information will be deleted.

### 4. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

Our Service is global by nature and your information can therefore be transferred anywhere in the world. Because different countries may have different information protection laws than your own country, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your information as explained in this Privacy Policy.
